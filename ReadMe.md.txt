This is the simple search engine app that is built by using Client Server Architecture. I used node js and ajax request 
Client-> sends the requist to the servers and the server is supposed to respond the answer with any valuable and additonal informations
Server-> Is dadicated to respond for any requist that comes from the client. 
There are also additional functions for this application like adding the word to the engine and editing and etc.
  Steps to run the app
1. start the server(nodejs)
2.type localhost:8080/words in your browser
